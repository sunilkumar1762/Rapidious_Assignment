Project Overview::

The EpiRecipes Visualization Application is a data analysis project that explores the most common ingredients in highly rated recipes. This project was developed to help enhance the user experience of a recipe platform by providing insights into ingredient trends, nutritional content, and user preferences.

Key Features::

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Processed raw recipe data, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations (bar charts, etc.) to display insights on popular ingredients in highly rated recipes.
Ingredient Frequency Analysis: Identified the top 10 most common ingredients used in highly rated recipes.
Nutritional Content Correlation: Explored the relationship between nutritional content (calories, protein, fat, sodium) and recipe ratings.
Recipe Categorization: Clustered recipes based on nutritional profiles and user ratings.

Objectives::

To identify the most common ingredients used in highly rated recipes.
To explore how nutritional content correlates with user ratings.
To provide insights into recipe trends and preferences for improving a recipe platform's recommendation algorithms.

Tools and Technologies::

Python: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization and graphical representations.

Data Cleaning Process::

Handled missing or inconsistent data in the ingredients and nutritional content fields.
Removed duplicates and standardized ingredient names.
Assumed missing values for certain fields based on related records and domain knowledge.

Challenges Faced::

Missing Values: Had to fill in missing nutritional content based on similar recipes.
Data Standardization: Ingredients had varied representations which were standardized for uniform analysis.
Handling Outliers: Some recipes had unusually high or low nutritional content, which was managed by applying appropriate filters.
Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations::

Top 10 Most Common Ingredients: A bar chart that highlights the most frequently used ingredients in highly rated recipes.
Nutritional Content Analysis: Scatter plots showcasing the correlation between recipe ratings and nutritional content like calories, protein, fat, and sodium.
Insights
Popular Ingredients: Ingredients like 'peanut-free' and 'vegetarian' were among the top in highly rated recipes.
Nutritional Correlations: Highly rated recipes generally had moderate nutritional content, particularly in terms of calories and protein.
Recipe Clustering: Recipes can be grouped into distinct categories based on their nutritional profiles, providing opportunities for better user segmentation.

Conclusion::

The insights derived from this analysis can be utilized to:
Improve recommendation systems on recipe platforms by incorporating popular ingredient preferences.
Cater to health-conscious users by promoting recipes aligned with their nutritional needs.
Personalize user experiences through tailored content based on recipe trends and nutritional data.
